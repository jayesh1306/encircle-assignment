# Encircle Software Developer Test Assignment
Recommended Tools 
1. Nodejs 
2. IDE

You can install nodejs from below link for any platform. I have used MacOS for this test. 
[Nodejs Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

I have used Visual studio code for running this script. You can find a link for the VSCode below

Steps to run script 
* Open terminal if you are using Linux/Mac. If you are using Windows, open cmd and run below command from root of the project 
* You can skip .js extension from cli, it will autodetect js file, provided only one file with that name. 
```
node script.js "(add (add 3 3) 3)"
```
